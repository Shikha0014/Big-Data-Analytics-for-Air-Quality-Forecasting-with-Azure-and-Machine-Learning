# Big-Data-Analytics-for-Air-Quality-Forecasting-with-Azure-and-Machine-Learning
A scalable solution for air quality forecasting using Big Data analytics, Azure services, and machine learning. Leverages real-time data processing and predictive modeling to monitor and forecast air pollution levels.

This project lays the groundwork for building a big data pipeline for **air quality forecasting** in Indian cities. It leverages **Azure Databricks**, **PySpark**, **CosmosDB**, and **XGBoost** to create, process, and model large-scale geospatial datasets for environmental prediction.


## Overview

This solution outlines the steps to build a scalable system for air quality forecasting using big data technologies. It includes collecting city-level data, enriching it with geographic coordinates, storing it in CosmosDB, and using machine learning to predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**.


## Objectives

- Collect a list of major Indian cities and their states.
- Geocode cities to retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Transform and process data using PySpark on Azure Databricks.
- Store the data in Azure CosmosDB for scalable access.
- Train and deploy an XGBoost model to predict AQI based on environmental and geographical features.


## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Scripting and data processing  
- **pandas**: Data wrangling and analysis  
- **PySpark on Azure Databricks**: Distributed big data processing  
- **Azure CosmosDB**: NoSQL geospatial data storage  
- **Requests & JSON**: For API interactions  
- **XGBoost**: Machine learning algorithm for AQI prediction  
- **Scikit-learn**: Preprocessing and model evaluation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Azure Machine Learning (optional)**: For model tracking and deployment  


## Workflow Summary

### Step 1: City Data Creation  
- Collected a list of 25 major Indian cities and their states.  
- Created a pandas DataFrame with this information.

### Step 2: Geocoding Cities  
- Used a geolocation API to fetch latitude and longitude values.  
- Added these coordinates to the DataFrame.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning & Export  
- Cleaned the dataset and exported it to `Data.csv`.

### Step 4: Loading with PySpark on Azure Databricks  
- Read the dataset into a PySpark DataFrame.  
- Configured Spark with CosmosDB to allow scalable NoSQL storage.

### Step 5: AQI Data Integration  
- Collected historical AQI readings for the selected cities from open APIs (e.g., OpenAQ).  
- Joined AQI data with city geolocation data based on city and timestamp.

### Step 6: Machine Learning with XGBoost  
- Features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and location were used.  
- Applied preprocessing (label encoding, missing value imputation, feature scaling).  
- Trained an **XGBoost regression model** to predict AQI.  
- Evaluated the model using RMSE and RÂ² metrics.  
- Model can be deployed or scheduled on Azure ML for continuous prediction.


## Observations

- AQI can be predicted with high accuracy using environmental and spatial data.
- XGBoost outperforms linear regression and decision trees for this kind of problem.
- Azure Databricks simplifies scaling and parallelizing both data preparation and model training.
- CosmosDB enables fast access to historical and real-time AQI data.


## Conclusion

This project showcases a full data pipeline for air quality forecasting. From geospatial data creation and scalable storage in CosmosDB to training an XGBoost model on Azure Databricks, it offers a modern solution to an important environmental challenge. The pipeline is extensible to support real-time prediction, visualization, and deployment using Azure Machine Learning and Power BI.
